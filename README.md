Timer for blind increases for private home poker games

We've been playing a monthly home poker game for over a decade, and we have a set timer for increasing blinds.
This helps us keep the game going between all the socialising, and makes for a higher stakes, more exciting
game as we reach the end of the evening.

I've been wanting to learn Flutter for a while, for no other reason than to see what the fuss is about.
I figured this could be a nice project for it.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
